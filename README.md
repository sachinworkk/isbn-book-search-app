## ü§ñ AI & Tooling Transparency

### AI Involvement

- **GPT-4.0, Claude 3.5 Sonnet** was used to:

  - Scaffold unit tests.
  - Generate commit messages and README drafts.

- AI served as a **pair programmer**, not an autonomous coder.

### Human Involvement

- All **business logic, architecture, and security-sensitive code** was written manually.
- AI-generated snippets were **reviewed, edited, and tested** before use.
- Debugging, deployments, and final design were handled by humans.
